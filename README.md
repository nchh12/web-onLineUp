# Note
This is my ongoing group project for Elements of Software Development course on developing a virtual waiting room application for both Web and Mobile (Android and iOS) platforms. This application aims to improve the queuing experience for everyone in various situations, ranging from healthcare, education to social affairs. My roles in the project include UX/UI design, front-end programming, and content writing. Also, as the main objectives of this course, I'm being introduced and have the chance to work with Rational Unified Process (RUP) and Scrum frameworks for software development.
